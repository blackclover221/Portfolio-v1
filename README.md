*Portfolio created using basic CSS and HTML*

--> Started off by creating fixing the title and changing it to my preferred title. 
--> then added the hero and the about me section wherby I highlighted some of my skills from my current non-tech role. I have created a division and paragraphs to ensure it is presneted neatly when reading 
--> I have edited the starter code for the work section ad added image source and spans to highlight some of my ongoing projects, and projects I have previosuly completed. 
--> the images used are from the images folder. 


// What went well //
* some of the things that went well was applying the knowledge learned in class. for instance when to use a division and how to style the css sheet. 

* using resources such as freecodecamp and youtube to learn various ways to style with basic css (without using bootstrap) 

// challenges faced // 

* knowing the idea and the image in my head of how I want my protfolio to look but struggling with applying it. Things like image size control and colours changing with a mouse hover. 
* Also the doing the mistake of using british spelling for colour and wondering why the changes are not happening
